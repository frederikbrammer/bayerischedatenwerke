    "description": "In the case of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG v. Arigna Technology Limited, the plaintiff, BMW, seeks a declaratory judgment of non-infringement regarding a patent owned by the defendant, Arigna. The legal basis for this claim rests on the assertion that BMW has not utilized the patented technology in question, thereby avoiding liability for infringement. The case highlights the complexities of patent law, particularly in the context of declaratory judgments, where the plaintiff seeks to clarify its legal standing in light of potential claims from the defendant. Relevant legal standards include the requirements for establishing patent infringement, which necessitate a showing that the accused product or process falls within the scope of the patent claims. Precedent cases such as MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118 (2007) may be cited to support the notion that a party may seek a declaratory judgment to resolve uncertainty regarding patent rights. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to demonstrate non-infringement, while the defendant may assert defenses based on the validity and enforceability of the patent.",

The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to establish these elements, and the defendant may raise defenses such as the absence of a breach or the applicability of warranty disclaimers.",
