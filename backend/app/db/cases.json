Sobran 7 Evergreen Lane Hingham, MA 02043 \nCounsel for Appellees \n3 \n    \n \nOPINION \n   \n AMBRO, Circuit Judge \n \nAfter the dust settles in a cl ass action lawsuit, lawyers \noften remain to squabble over class counsel fees.  Trying to avoid that fate, the parties here  made an agreement: Appellant \nBMW of North America, LLC w ould not object to an award \nup to $1,500,000, and class counsel would not request an award \nabove $3,700,000.  BMW now a ppeals the District Court\u2019s \napproval of a fee award at the upper limit of that range.  It argues (1) that the Court\u2019s cal culation of the \u201clodestar\u201d \n(essentially a multiplication of the hours counsel reasonably \nbill on a case by a reasonable h ourly rate) was based on an \ninsufficient record, and (2) that the Court erred in applying a \nlodestar multiplier to the fee award.  We agree with BMW that \nthe lodestar was based on an insu fficient record and so vacate \nthe District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.   \n \nI. Background \nThis appeal stems from the settlement of a consumer \nclass action suit filed in 2017  against BMW and its German \nparent,1 claiming they knowingly manufactured and sold \nvehicles equipped with defectiv e N20 and N26 engines.  After \nthe District Court granted in pa rt and denied in part BMW\u2019s \n \n1 The parties later stipulated to the dismissal of BMW\u2019s parent, \nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktienges ellschaft, as a defendant.   \n4 \n motion to dismiss, the named plaintiffs filed a Second \nConsolidated Amended Complaint bringing 20 causes of action under federal and state la w, including an alleged breach \nof warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2301 et seq.  (a federal fee-shifting statute), breach of \nthe implied warranty of merchantability, violation of various state consumer fraud and deceptiv e trade practice statutes, and \nunjust enrichment.   \n The parties subsequently engaged a mediator and \nreached a settlement to reimburs e class members for expenses \nincurred and provide them extende d warranties.   Because they \ndid not know how many consumers would be eligible or make \nclaims for certain benefits, the total value of the settlement was \nunknown.  The District Cour t nonetheless concluded it was \nworth at least $27 milli on.  As part of the settlement, the parties \n\u201cagree[d] to submit the issue of at torneys\u2019 fees\u201d to a Magistrate \nJudge \u201cfor final evaluation and decision of the exact amount of \n. . . fees . . . that should reasona bly be awarded in this case.\u201d  \nWhile the Court would have the final say, the parties decided \nto resolve the fee issu e with a \u201chigh-low\u201d provision, stipulating \nthat  \n Settlement Class Counsel may apply to the Court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees . . . and [BMW] \nmay object to or oppose that application, \nalthough [BMW] will not object to Settlement \nClass Counsel\u2019s application for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees [of] . . . up to $1,500,0 00 in the \naggregate.  While not agreeing to the total amount of such an award, the Parties have agreed \nthat Settlement Class Counsel may apply for an  \n5 \n award of attorneys\u2019 fees  . . . not to exceed \n$3,700,000 in the aggregate.   \nId.   \n Class counsel sought $3.7 m illion in attorneys\u2019 fees, the \nmaximum allowable under the high-low provision, submitting \nto the Magistrate Judge three ch arts (one for each plaintiffs\u2019 \nfirm) detailing at a summary le vel the time devoted to various \ncategories of legal work, aggr egated across the entire three-\nyear litigation period.   \n \n \n \n\n6 \n  \nId. at 218\u201319. \n \nId. at 241.  \n\n7 \n  \nId. at 254.  In addition, class counsel filed declarations that \nadded more detail about the work completed while still not specifying the time sp ent on particular tas ks, who did those \ntasks, or the dates they were performed, and d eclarations that \ndescribed the experience of each lawyer who billed for the \ncase.  BMW objected to the ma ximum fee request.  It argued, \namong other things, that (1) class counsel did not provide \nenough documentation to support the requested lodestar award, \nand (2) a lodestar multiplier (a fac tor by which a lodestar award \nis enhanced) was unwarranted here.   \n \n The Magistrate Judge held a telephonic hearing.  After listening to the parties\u2019 arguments, the Court ruled that the summary charts were \u201cm ore than sufficient\u201d  and provided \u201ca \ngood indicator of the time spent.\u201d  Id. at 436.   Applying the \nlodestar approach, it adopted cla ss counsel\u2019s requested lodestar \n\n8 \n amount of $1,934,000.  It th en applied class counsel\u2019s \nrequested multiplier of 1.9 to re ach a total fee award of $3.7 \nmillion\u2014the full amount class counsel sought.  BMW now appeals.  \n \nII. Standard of Review\n2 \nThough we lo ok anew (or de novo ) at the legal standards \nused by the Court to calculat e a fee award, \u201cso long as it \nemploys correct standards and procedures and makes findings \nof fact [that are] not clearly erroneous,\u201d a district court has \ndiscretion to decide the amount of an award.  In re Rite Aid \nCorp. Sec. Litig. , 396 F.3d 294, 299 (3d Cir. 2005) (quoting \nPub. Interest Research Grp.  of N.J., Inc. v. Windall , 51 F.3d \n1179, 1184 (3d Cir. 1995)).  We also  require that district courts \n\u201cclearly set forth their reasoning fo r fee awards so that we will \nhave a sufficient basis to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d  Id. \nat 301.   \nIII. Discussion \nA. Waiver of the right to appeal  the District Court\u2019s fee \ndetermination  Before addressing the merits  of BMW\u2019s arguments, we \naddress a threshold issue: whether BMW waived its right to \nappeal the District Court\u2019s attorn eys\u2019 fees ruling through (1) its \npurported judicial admissions, or (2) by agreeing to submit the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees to the District Court \u201cfor final evaluation and decision,\u201d Appx. at  199.  We conclude no.  \n \n2 The District Court had juri sdiction under the diversity \nprovision of the Class Action Fa irness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(d).  We have jurisdic tion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \n9 \n   \nAs to the former, class coun sel contends the \u201cdoctrine \nof \u2018judicial admissions\u2019\u201d bars BMW\u2019s appeal here.  Appellee \nBr. 24 n.18.  They point to an exchange between the Court and \nChristopher Dalton (BMW\u2019s counsel) that occurred \nimmediately after it grante d class counsel\u2019s motion for \nattorneys\u2019 fees.  The Court asked Mr. Dalton if there was \u201canything you need\u2014or I need to  put on the record for your \npurposes.\u201d  Appx. at 437.  Mr. Dalton replied: \u201cYour Honor has already gone through her ba ses and rationale for making \nthis determination.  We put it in the hands of the Court, and \nyou\u2019ve made your decision, Judge.\u201d  Id.   \n Case law requires that judicial admissions be \n\u201cunequivocal\u201d or \u201cdeliberate,  clear, and unambiguous.\u201d   In re \nMotors Liquidation Co. , 957 F.3d 357, 360 (2d Cir. 2020) (per \ncuriam) (collecting cases).  As Mr. Dalton\u2019s statements can be \nplausibly construed as merely acknowledging the adverse \nresult of the hearing, they do not meet this standard.   \n \nAlternatively, class counse l argues BMW waived its \nright to appeal by agreeing \u201cto submit the issue of attorneys\u2019 \nfees\u201d to the Magistrate Judge \u201c for final evaluation  and \ndecision \u201d of the fee amount \u201cwithin the $1,500,000 to \n$3,700,000 range agreed upon by the Parties.\u201d  Appx. at 199 \n(emphasis added).  But the plai n language of this provision \ndoes not explicitly waive either party\u2019s right to appeal.  Rather, it provides only that the District  Court would decide the issue \nafter briefing and argument,\n3 plus it is silent as to appellate \nrights.   \n \n3 Class counsel also points to non-published decisions from our \nCourt dealing with high-low fee provisions\u2014 Vargo v. \n10 \n  \nOur inquiry does not end here , however.  We must also \nconsider whether BMW waived its right to appeal by not explicitly reserving that right in the agreement.  To this, In re \nOdyssey Contracting Corp. , 944 F.3d 483 (3d Cir. 2019), is \ninstructive.  There we consider ed whether Odyssey waived its \nright to appeal a bankruptcy court\u2019s determination of a payment dispute in an adversary proceeding.  It had signed a \nstipulation stating that if the Court made a certain determination, \u201call of the Par ties\u2019 pending claims will be \nwithdrawn and disposed of in their entirety with prejudice,\u201d \nand the proceeding \u201cshall be deemed  to be finally concluded in \nall respects.\u201d  Id. at 487\u201388.  The stipul ation was silent on the \nspecific right to appeal.  Id. at 488.  After the Bankruptcy Court \nmade the relevant determina tion, Odyssey appealed the \ndismissal of its claims to the Di strict Court and, eventually, our \nCourt.  Id. at 486.   We held Odyssey had waived its right to \nappeal because \u201cthe party seek ing to appeal must make its \nintent to do so clear at th e time of the stipulation.\u201d  Id. at 489.   \n In that ruling we distingui shed the stipulation in \nOdyssey  from class action settlement cases in which other \n \nMangus , 94 F. App\u2019x 941 (3d Cir. 2004), and Bryan v. Erie \nCnty. Off. of Children & Youth , 637 F. App\u2019x 693 (3d Cir. \n2016)\u2014and a New Jersey Supreme Court decision discussing high-low agreements in th e context of jury trials\u2014 Serico v. \nRothberg , 189 A.3d 343, 349\u201351 (N.J . 2018).  But because the \nattorneys\u2019 fees provision at i ssue here does not include an \nunambiguous, explicit waiver of appeal, the Third Circuit cases \nfall off point.  Serico  is also out of place,  as it merely involved \nenforcing the upper bound of a high-low agreement according \nto the agreement\u2019s plain language.  Id.  \n11 \n circuits have required express waiver of the right to appeal \nwhen the parties have stipulat ed that a court will decide a \ncertain issue.  Id. (citing In re Deepwater Horizon , 785 F.3d \n986, 997 (5th Cir. 2015); Montez v. Hickenlooper , 640 F.3d \n1126, 1132 (10th Cir. 20 11)).  We explained that \u201c[t]he interest \nat stake in those cases was different from that at issue\u201d in Odyssey  because \u201c[i]n class actions, settlement agreements \ncannot be approved unless the c ourt determines that they are \nfundamentally fair, reasonable, and adequate, the purpose of which is to protect unnamed me mbers of the class from unjust \nor unfair settlements.\u201d  Id. at 489\u201390 (interna l quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201c[T]hat interest d[id] not apply in [ Odyssey ], which \ninvolve[d] a dispute between so phisticated business entities.\u201d  \nId. at 490.   \n As our case presents a situati on closer to the class action \ncases distinguished in Odyssey , we  hold that stipulations \nregarding attorneys\u2019 fees in class actions must contain an \nexpress waiver of appeal.  This tracks our case law in this area, \nwhich recognizes that the \u201cunique relationship among \nplaintiffs\u2019 counsel, plaintiffs, and defendants in class actions \nimposes a special responsibility upon appellate courts to hear challenges to fee awards.\u201d  In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig. , \n243 F.3d 722, 728 (3d Cir. 2001).  Because BMW did not \nexpressly waive its right to appeal the District Court\u2019s fee \ndetermination, it preserved that right.  \n  \nB. Sufficiency of the record underlying the District \nCourt\u2019s lodestar calculation  \n With waiver out of the way,  we turn to the merits.  \nBMW argues the District Court granted class counsel\u2019s fee \nrequest on an insufficien t record.  We agree.  \n12 \n  \nFor context, there are two main ways to calculate \nattorneys\u2019 fees: the percenta ge-of-recovery method and the \nlodestar method.  See Cendant , 243 F.3d at 732.  The former is \nas simple as it\u2019s named.  \u201cLod estar,\u201d though, is a term-of-art \nused by courts to denote an award that is \u201ccalculated by \nmultiplying the number of hours [the lawyer] reasonably worked on a client\u2019s case by a reasonable hourly billing rate \nfor such services based on the given geographical area, the nature of the services provide d, and the experience of the \nattorney[].\u201d  Rite Aid , 396 F.3d at 305.  These approaches are \ntypically employed in diffe rent contexts.  While the \n\u201cpercentage-of-recovery method is  generally favored in cases \ninvolving a common fund,\u201d the lodestar method, pioneered by \nour Court in Lindy Brothers Builders, In c. of Philadelphia v. \nAmerican Radiator & St andard Sanitary Corp. , 487 F.2d 161 \n(3d Cir. 1973), \u201cis more commonly applied in statutory fee-shifting cases . . . .\u201d  In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales \nPractice Litig. , 148 F.3d 283, 333 (3d Cir. 1998).  The lodestar \napproach may also be used in cases, such as here, \u201cwhere the \nnature of the recovery does not allow the determination of the \nsettlement\u2019s value necessary for application of the percentage-\nof-recovery method.\u201d\n4  Id.   \n As such, was the District Court\u2019s calculation of the \nlodestar award based on a suffi cient record?  Our case law \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny hours to be used in calculating attorneys\u2019 \nfees . . . be detailed with sufficient specificity.\u201d  Keenan v. City \nof Philadelphia , 983 F.2d 459, 472 (1992 ).  In other words, the \n \n4 As BMW does not challenge the District Court\u2019s choice to \nuse the lodestar method, we do not question that aspect of its \nruling.  \n13 \n fee application must \u201cbe specifi c enough to allow the district \ncourt to determine if the hours claimed are unreasonable for the \nwork performed.\u201d  Rode v. Dellarciprete , 892 F.2d 1177, 1190 \n(3d Cir. 1990) (inter nal quotation marks omitted).  The petition \nshould therefore \u201cinclude \u2018some fairly definite information as \nto the hours devoted to various ge neral activities, e. g.[,] pretrial \ndiscovery, settlement negotiations, and the hours spent by various classes of attorneys, e.g., senior partners, junior partners, associates.\u2019\u201d  Keenan , 983 F.2d at 473 (quoting Rode , \n892 F.2d at 1190).  \u201c[I]t is not  necessary,\u201d however, \u201cto know \nthe exact number of minutes spent nor the precise activity to \nwhich each hour was devoted nor the specific attainments of \neach attorney.\u201d  Rode , 892 F.2d at 1190 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).   \n BMW argues the summary charts submitted by class \ncounsel cannot justify the award because they \u201cdo not detail in \nany explicit manner how the to tal hours worked . . . were \ngenerated.\u201d  Appellant Br. at 14.  In particular, it contends the \ncharts \u201cprovided no dates to info rm the District Court of when \nthe task was performed; nor . . . information to show what any \nspecific activity was, how much time was devoted to any \nspecific activity, on any specific date, by which specific \nindividual, for a particular charge.\u201d  Id. at 15 (citing Appx. at \n218\u201319, 241, 254) (emphases in  original).  As an initial \nobservation, we note that the summary charts total only three \npages  but purport to summarize hours billed across a three-\nyear period.  And while the charts  do provide some information \nabout the hours devoted to litigation activities (such as \n\u201cDiscovery Activities,\u201d \u201cPre -Litigation Investigation,\u201d \n\u201cDrafting Complaints (original/amended)\u201d), the hours billed \nby each attorney are aggregated across the entir e three-year \nlitigation period.  Appx. at 218\u201319 , 241, 254.  That sort of \n14 \n aggregation, without more detail, is an insufficient basis for an \nattorneys\u2019 fee award.5  See Keenan , 983 F.2d at 473 (portion of \nfee petition consisting of summari es detailing \u201conly monthly \ncumulative totals of [attorney\u2019s] hours\u201d wa s not \u201csufficiently \nspecific\u201d).6  We simply cannot discern from the charts whether \ncertain hours are duplicative (a determination that is particularly crucial here, given that three plaintiffs\u2019 firms seek fees for performing the same categories of work) or whether the total hours billed were reasona ble for the work performed.   \n In a last-ditch attempt to salvage the award, class \ncounsel asserts they \u201coffer[ed] to  provide the [District Court] \nwith several hundred pages of contemporaneous billing \nrecords,\u201d but it declined  the offer.  Appellees Br. at 30.  While \n \n5 Class counsel caution against re stricting our review to the \nsummary charts, pointing to, among other things, their \ndeclarations \u201cdescribing discre te tasks engaged in by each \nfirm.\u201d  Appellees Br. at 30.  But the declarations do not \nassociate the discrete tasks with  particular time-keepers or the \ntime spent on the tasks detailed therein.  More fundamentally, there is no way to use those declarations with the summary \ncharts (and other information pr ovided) to discern whether the \nhours reported by class counsel were reasonable for the work \nperformed.    \n6 BMW also argues the summary charts \u201cdo not comply with \nthe District of New Jersey\u2019s re quirements for fee applications,\u201d \nas laid out in that Court\u2019s local rules.  See Appellant Br. at 30; \nD.N.J. L. Civ. R. 54.2.  Wh ile we may overturn a district \ncourt\u2019s ruling for failing to abide by its own local rules in some \ncircumstances, see Advanced Fluid Systems, Inc. v. Huber , 958 \nF.3d 168, 181 (3d Cir. 2020), we need not reach this issue here, \nas we are overturning the fee aw ard on an altern ative ground.  \n15 \n not required, \u201ccontemporaneously  recorded time sheets are the \npreferred practice.\u201d  Keenan , 983 F.2d at 472 (alteration \nadopted) (quoting Webb v. Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 471 U.S. 234, \n238 n.6 (1985)).  And th at preference is especially strong here, \nwhere class counsel\u2019s summary charts were so condensed, \nhigh-level, and lacking in specif ic detail that we would likely \nneed the underlying billing reco rds to parse them.  So class \ncounsel\u2019s mere offer to provi de the District Court more \ndocumentation does not cure the Court\u2019s failure to take counsel up on that offer and review th e complete records.  As its \nlodestar award was thus based on an insufficient record, we \nvacate its order and remand for further proceedings.    \n \nC. The propriety of applying a lodestar multiplier to \nthe fee award  \n BMW also argues the District  Court improperly applied \na lodestar multiplier to class counsel\u2019s fee award.  It cites \nPerdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn , in which the Supreme Court \nheld that \u201cthere is a \u2018strong pr esumption\u2019 that the lodestar \nfigure is reasonable, but that presumption may be overcome in \nthose rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately take into account a factor that may properly be \nconsidered in determining a reas onable fee.\u201d  559 U.S. 542, \n554 (2010).  Because Perdue concerned federal fee-shifting \nstatutes, id. at 547, the parties disagr ee about whether it applies \nhere.  Class counsel maintains Perdue does not govern, as our \nmatter \u201cis not a pure statutory fee shifting case because it \nencompasses common law counts in cluding unjust enrichment, \nequitable relief claims, and breach of express and implied warranty counts which survived BMW[\u2019s] motion to dismiss.\u201d  \nAppellees Br. at 38.  BMW, on the other hand, contends \n\u201cmultipliers are inappropriate wh ere fees are based on a fee-\n16 \n shifting statute, determined by a lodestar calculation, as they \nwere here.\u201d  Reply Br. at 11.  \n As we vacate and remand the District Court\u2019s fee award \nbecause the lodestar calculati on was based on an insufficient \nrecord, we decline to decide whether the District Court was bound by the strictures of Perdue in considering a fee \nenhancement.  We do, however, no te two things for the parties \nand the Court to consider on remand.  First, we think the \nparties\u2019 focus on the statutes un der which named plaintiffs sued \nis misplaced, as the \u201cCourt awarded the attorney\u2019s fees \npursuant to a contract\u2014the settlement agreement\u2014not \npursuant to a statute.\u201d  In re Home Depot Inc. , 931 F.3d 1065, \n1082 (11th Cir. 2019); see also Brytus v. Spang & Co. , 203 \nF.3d 238, 246 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201cWhen there has been a settlement, the basis for the stat utory fee has been discharged, \nand it is only the fund that remains.\u201d).  Second, we urge the District Court on remand to provide additional reasoning for \nits decision whether to add a lodestar multiplier.  In the fee \nhearing, the Court explained it would add a multiplier of 1.9 \nbecause it \u201cis well within approved multip liers in our \njurisdiction,\u201d and because the award \u201cfalls well within the \nappropriate Gunter factors.\u201d  Appx. at 437 (citing Gunter v. \nRidgewood Energy Corp. , 223 F.3d 190 (3d Cir. 2000)).  This \nis not enough reasoning to give us  \u201ca sufficient basis to review\u201d \nits fee enhancement.  Rite Aid , 396 F.3d at 301.   \n* * * \nIn their class action settleme nt the parties agreed to \ncabin class counsel\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees reque st within a high-low \nrange, subject to final determina tion by the District Court.  \nThough it granted a fee award at the high end of that range, its \ncalculation was not supported by th e record before it.  Because \n17 \n we cannot tell whether the hour s class counsel billed were \nreasonable for the work performed,  we vacate the Court\u2019s order \nand remand for furt her proceedings.   \n \n\n\n",
