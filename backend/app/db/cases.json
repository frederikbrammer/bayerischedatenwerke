Ruff, the plaintiff, Autovest, alleges that the defendants, Gerry and Adrienne Ruff, defaulted on a promissory note executed on October 17, 2014, with an original sum of $20,488.81. The legal standard for breach of contract requires the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a valid contract, the defendant's breach of that contract, and resultant damages. Autovest has provided evidence of the promissory note and the default, which establishes the basis for its claim. The defendants' failure to fulfill the terms of the note constitutes a breach, thereby entitling Autovest to seek recovery of the owed amount, including interest. The burden of proof lies with Autovest to establish the breach and the amount due, while the defendants may raise defenses related to the enforceability of the note or any alleged agreements that may have modified the original terms.",
