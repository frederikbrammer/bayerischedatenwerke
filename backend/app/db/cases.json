    "description": "The case of Carmen Wannamaker-Amos v. Purem Novi, Inc. presents a claim of employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to disparate treatment based on her race, as evidenced by the differential treatment she received from her supervisor, Javad Hosseini, who is alleged to have harbored discriminatory animus against her. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the plaintiff must demonstrate that she is a member of a protected class, was qualified for her position, suffered an adverse employment action, and that similarly situated employees outside her protected class were treated more favorably. The burden of proof initially lies with the plaintiff to establish these elements, after which the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. The plaintiff may then demonstrate that the employer's stated reason is a pretext for discrimination. Relevant precedents include McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), which outlines the burden-shifting framework applicable in employment discrimination cases.",
