Ct. No. 161863)  \n \n \n \n \n Cross -complainants  and appellants Antonio Arriagarazo and Alicia Rodriguez de \nArriaga  (appellants)  accepted an offer to compromise their wrongful death suit against \ncross -defendants and respondents BMW of North America and Bayerische Motoren \nWerke AG (BMW) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998,1 agreeing to sign a \ngeneral release in exchange for monetary payment.  Judgment was entered on the \n \n1 Undesignated statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.  \n2 compromise, however the trial court subsequently vacated the judgment as void on the \nground that BMW\u2019s section 998 offer purportedly did not contemplate entry of judgment .  \nAppellants contend the trial court erred in vacating judgment.   We agree with appellants \nand will reverse the trial court\u2019s order.   \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \n In January 2014, appellants \u2019 son was injured in a car accident.  He died in March \n2016 , and appellants  filed this wrongful death action  via cross -complaint against BMW  \nin September 2016 .   \n On April 3, 2019, BMW  served appellants  with an offer to compromise pursuant \nto section 998.  In exchange for $15,000 as \u201csettlement of all claims and causes of action \nbeing litigated in this action against [BMW] ,\u201d appellants  would \u201cexecute a general \nrelease of all claims and causes of action against [BMW] , with each side to bear their \nown costs and attorney fees.\u201d  The offer did not otherwise specify how the case was to be \nfinally resolved , nor did it include a draft of the p roposed general release .  Appellants had \n30 days in which to accept the offer.   \n On April 10, 2019, counsel for appellants  signed and returned an executed copy of \nthe section 998 offer acceptance form .  The same day, a ppellants filed a notice of \nsettlemen t indicating a request for dismissal would be filed within 45 days after the \nsettlement .  Later that day, c ounsel for BMW  acknowledged receipt and promised to \nprovide a draft general release \u201cshortly.\u201d   \n On April 17, 2019, counsel for BMW  e-mailed  appella nts\u2019 counsel a proposed \nrelease2 and informed appellants  that BMW  \u201croutinely require [ ] a basic confidentiality \nclause\u201d that would be included in the release.  Counsel for appellants  asked why the \nsettlement agreement was necessary, given that it was not part of the section 998 \n \n2 The record does not include any attachment to this e -mail.   \n3 agreement and that a judgment was to be filed.  BMW\u2019s counsel replied that in its section \n998 offers, \u201cwe don\u2019t provide for entry of a judgment, instead we provide for settlement \nand execution of a r elease exactly for this reason.\u201d  Appellants \u2019 counsel responded that a \nsimple release would be fine, given that no confidentiality was contemplated or agreed \nupon.   \n On May 6, 2019, BMW \u2019s counsel sent appellants \u2019 counsel a copy of the proposed \nrelease.  U nder its terms , appellants  would agree to release BMW  from any claim or \ncause of action, whether known or unknown, arising from the January 2014 car accident.  \nAppellants also would provide a general release pursuant to Civil Code section 1542.   \nThe agreem ent included confidentiality and indemnity clauses.  Finally, appellants  would \nfile a request for dismissal with prejudice within five days of receiving the settlement \nproceeds.  BMW\u2019s counsel informed appellants  that BMW  was \u201cinsisting\u201d on the \nconfidentia lity clause.   \n Appellants refused to sign the document prepared by BMW.  Instead, o n May 21, \n2019, appellants  signed and sent a different general release to BMW \u2019s counsel , one that \ndid not include confidentiality or indemnity clause s.  It also  specified that , because  the \nrelease arose from the acceptance of a section 998 offer, a written judgment for the \ncourt\u2019s signature  would be filed .  BMW\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cThank you!\u201d and offered \nto send a check promptly once payee information was recei ved.   \n Appellants\u2019  counsel then sent to BMW \u2019s counsel a proposed  stipulated  judgment  \nreflecting $15,00 0 in damages .  The judgment stated it was pursuant to the accepted \nsection 998 offer to compromise.  BMW\u2019s counsel replied via e -mail that it was not \nstipulating to entry of a judgment since the section 998 offer \u201cprovides for a settlement \nand release, not entry of judgment.\u201d  The stipulated judgment was entered by the trial \ncourt on May 28, 2019 .   \n On May 29, 2019, BMW \u2019s counsel learned during a court ap pearance that the \njudgment had been submitted  to the court  (but was unaware that it had been  entered  by \n4 the trial court a day before ).  She e-mailed appellants \u2019 counsel expressing \u201cdismay\u201d that \nappellants\u2019 counsel  had done so despite her expressed opposition.  A legal secretary for  \nappellants \u2019 counsel responded that , to the best of her knowledge, the judgment  had not \nyet been signed by the court or fil ed.   \n On June 3, 2019, BMW  submitted a written objection to entr y of the judgment.  \nBMW\u2019s counsel still assumed the judgment had not been entered because she had not \nreceived any notice from the court .   \n On September 2 5, 2019, BMW \u2019s counsel learned during a case management \nconference that judgment had in fact been ent ered by the court on May 28, 2019.  The \ntrial court acknowledged that it had not provided notice of the entry of judgment, and that \nthe judgment had only recently been placed on the docket.  The court deemed September \n25 to be the date that BMW  received notice of entry of the judgment .   \n On September 26, 2019, BMW \u2019s counsel proposed a resolution whereby the \njudgment would be vacated by stipulation  and a request for dismissal would be filed \ninstead , in exchange for execution of a settlement agree ment and release without  a \nconfidentiality clause.  Appellants\u2019 counsel did not respond  to this offer .   \n On October 10, 2019, BMW  moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to section \n437, subdivisions (a)(1) and (d), and section 663.  BMW  argued appellants  submitted an \nerroneous proposed judgment to the court , over BMW \u2019s objection.  According to BMW , \nit never stipulated to entry of judgment.  BMW requested the court to resolve the matter \nas provided in the section 998 offer, which BMW  argued meant a settlement  payment in \nexchange for a release and a filed request for dismissal.  BMW  stated it would not require \na confidentiality clause in the release.   \nAppellants  objected, arguing the judgment accurately reflected the parties\u2019 intent  \nas expressed in the section 998 offer .  Appellants also noted they had provided BMW  \nwith a copy of the proposed judgment a week before it was entered.  In addition, \nappellants  argued that section 998 contemplated and called for entry of judgment, and \n5 there was no mistake, fraud, misunderstanding, or other ground that would require the \ncourt to vacate the judgment.   \nAfter a hearing,3 the trial court vacated the judgment pursuant to section 473, \nsubdivision (d).  Specifically, t he court found the judgment was void because it was not \ncontemplated by the terms of the settlement offer.  Appellants timely appeal ed.   \nDISCUSSION  \n Appellants  argue the trial court erred in vacating the judgment and abused its \ndiscretion in interpreting the section 998 offer as req uiring appellants  to dismiss their \ncase against BMW  as part of the bargain .  Appellants  note that the offer neither called for \na judgment nor a dismissal , and that section 998 , subdivision (b)  results in a judgment \nunless otherwise specified in the offer.  Given the offer\u2019s silence about how the case was \nto be concluded , appellants  argue the contract must be interpreted as including the \nstatutory default  of judgment .  Appellants  argue BMW  had t he burden of drafting the \noffer with sufficient precision and cannot later unilaterally add terms and conditions.   \n BMW  contend s the trial court properly vacated the judgment because the parties \nnever stipulate d to enter judgment under the section 998 off er.  Citing Berg v. Darden \n(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 721  (Berg ), American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter \n& Hampton (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017  (American Airlines ), and Goodstein v. Bank of \nSan Pedro (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 899  (Goodstein ), BMW  notes there is no requirement \nthat a section 998 offer result in judgment.  Without citing any authority, BMW  argue s \nthe offer\u2019s general release requirement conveyed its intention to resolve the matter by \nway of a dismissal since a release is \u201cnormally followed  by a request for dismissal.\u201d  In \nthe alternative, BMW  argue s that it \u201cimmediately clarified \u201d any uncertainty regarding the \n \n3 The record does not contain a transcript of the hearing.  \n6 disposition of the litigation  in its correspondence with appellants  \u201cshortly after the \nsettlement was reached .\u201d4   \n We agree  with appellants .  \n We review for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a section 473 \nmotion and vacate a judgment entered pursuant to a section 998 compromise .  (See \nPazderka v. Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 658, 669 ; see also \nUriarte v. United States Pipe & Foundry Co. (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 780, 787 .) \n Under section 998, a party to a civil action \u201c may serve an offer in writing upon \nany other party  to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in \naccordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time. \u201d  (\u00a7 998, subd. (b).)  The \noffer must include \u201c the terms and conditions of the judgment or award .\u201d  (Ibid.)  Once the \noffer is accepted, \u201cthe offer with proof of acceptance shall be filed and the clerk or the \njudge shall enter judgment accordingly. \u201d5  (\u00a7 998, subd. (b)(1).)   \n Because the section 998 process is contractual, we apply well -established contract \nlaw principles  to section 998 offers and acceptances , unless there is a conflict with \nsection 998 or applying such principles defeat its purpose.   (T.M. Cobb Co. v. Superior \nCourt (1984) 36 Cal.3d 273, 279-280.)  In interpreting a contract, the mutual intention of \nthe p arties at the time the contract was formed governs.  (Civ. Code, \u00a7  1636; Moss Dev . \nCo. v. Geary (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 1, 9.)  We ascertain that intention solely from the \nwords used, but we also consider the circumstances under which the contract was made \n \n4 To the extent BMW  argue s the trial court had alternative bas es to vacate the \njudgment under section 473, subdivision (a)(1) , and section 663, we note that the trial \ncourt stated its ruling was solely based on section 473, subdivision (d).  We will limit ou r \nreview accordingly .   \n5 When a plaintiff does not accept the offer and fails to obtain a more favorable \njudgment at trial, then the plaintiff cannot recover postoffer costs and must pay the \ndefendant\u2019s postoffer costs.  (\u00a7 998, subd. (c)(1).)  \n7 and the matter to which it relates.  (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7  1639, 1647; Moss Dev . Co., supra , at p. \n9.)  We consider the contract as a whole and give the words their usual and ordinary \nmeaning, unless the words are given a special meaning or used in a technical sense.  (Civ. \nCode, \u00a7\u00a7  1641, 1644; Moss Dev . Co., at p. 9.)  Courts must refrain from al tering or \nrewriting a contract, and they must not  \u201cadd a term to a contract about which the \nagreement is silent.\u201d  ( Moss Dev . Co., at p. 9.)  \n As our Supreme Court has explained , \u201c[a]lthough the acceptance of a section 998 \noffer leads to the entry of a judg ment  (\u00a7 998, subd. (b)(1)) , a section 998 offer may also \nrequire the plaintiff to dismiss the action as a condition of settlement.\u201d  ( DeSaulles v. \nCommunity Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140, 1155 , italics  added .)  \nFor example, in both American Airlines  and Goodstein , the court declined to invalidate a \nsection 998 offer  that called for dismissal with prejudice, rather than judgment against the \ndefendant.   (American Airlines, supra , 96 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1054 -1056 ; Goodstein, \nsupra , 27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 905 -906.)  The plaintiffs in both cases had argued section \n998 requires an offer to include the option of a judgment .  (American Airlines , at p. 1054 ; \nGoodstein , at p. 905.)  The courts disagreed, reasoning that section 998 only requires  that \nthe compromise result s in a final disposition of the underlying litigation , and a dismissal \nis the legal equivalent of a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor .  (American Airlines , at pp. \n1055 -1056; Goodstein , at pp. 906 -907.)   \n However, unlike American  Airlines  and Goodstein , the section 998 offer  here \nnever specified that appellants  would be required to execute a dismissal in exchange for \nthe $15,000 settlement.  Although the offer did require appellants  to sign a general \nrelease, BMW  cites no authority that would require us to treat \u201c general release\u201d as a \ntechnical term that would indicate that appellants  would have been required to execute a \ndismissal  rather than allow judgment to be entered .  Indeed, as demonstrated by the \ndifferent general releases drafted by the parties, a general release does not necessarily \nrequire dismissal of the underlying lawsuit.   \n8  As explained in Berg , where a section 998 offer sets out certain settlement terms \nbut fails to specify whether acceptance would result in judgment, an award, or dismissal , \n\u201cthe offer, by virtue of default to the statutory languag e, is simply intended as one to \n\u2018allow judgment to be taken\u2019 in exchange for the specified amount of funds.\u201d  ( Berg, \nsupra , 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 728 .)  As the Berg court explained, under section 998, entry \nof judgment is \u201cthe expected and standard procedural result unless specific terms and \nconditions stated in the offer provide otherwise.\u201d  ( Id. at p. 730.)   \n As the drafter, BMW  had the duty to make clear in its section 998 offer any \nintention to stray from the usual path under section 998 of entry  of judgment .  (See Taing \nv. Johnson Scaffolding Co . (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 579, 585 [the offeror bears the burden \nof assuring the offer is drafted with sufficient precision to  permit the recipient to \nmeaningfully evaluate it and make a reasoned decision whe ther to accept it].)   If BMW  \nhad wished to deviate from the standard procedural result of section 998, it could have \nproposed a general release  coupled with a dismissal  or otherwise stated clearly in the \noffer that dismissal was required.  As courts have explained, \u201c[t]he true, subjective, but \nunexpressed intent of a party is immaterial and irrelevant.\u201d  ( Vaillette v. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nIns. Co. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 680, 690  [finding a party ha d no right to recover attorney \nfees when he failed to reserve this right in the agreement ].)   \nGiven that appellants  unconditionally accepted the section 998 offer as written, we \nare not persuaded that BMW \u2019s e-mailed \u201cclarifications\u201d should alter the resul t.6  (See \nIgnacio v. Caracciolo  (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 81, 86  [a section 998  offer \u201cmust be strictly \nconstrued in favor of the party sought to be bound by it\u201d ]; Pazderka  v. Caballeros Dimas \n \n6 At oral argument, counsel for BMW emphasized that BMW , in an e -mail,  objected \nto entry of a stipulated judgment .  This fact is of no legal consequence.  Because BMW \ndid not require appellant s to dismiss the action as a condition of settlement  in its sectio n \n998 offer, we default to the text of the statute, which contemplates entry of judgment.  \n9 Alang, Inc. , supra , 62 Cal.App.4th at pp. 671 -672 [reversing trial court\u2019s order to set \naside a judgment where counsel had mistakenly failed to include attorney fees and costs \nin the section 998 offer to compromise]; see also Poster v. Southern Cal . Rapid Transit \nDist. (1990) 52 Cal.3d 266, 272  [favoring \u201cbright line\u201d rule in interpreting section 998].)   \n In finding that the section 998 offer did not contemplate judgment, the trial court \nabused its discretion and modified the offer\u2019s terms.  We therefore will reverse the trial \ncourt\u2019s order.  \nDISPOSITION  \n The order vacating judgment is reversed .  Appellants are awarded their costs on \nappeal.   (Cal.
